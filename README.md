### Title of the project: MBTA Real Time Bus Tracker
Description of the project: In this exerise we use mapbox's API to Show the Buses Locations in Route#1 of MBTA in real time, we use await and fetch to load real time data from MBTA.<br>
How to Run: Select the link in Centurion Tech's Portfolio > Projects ,click on the button "Show MBTA Route# 1 Bus Locations in real time" <br>
Roadmap of future improvements: By the now I added sound effects, but in the future I will show a table of current buses in Route# 1 or other route selected.
